My name is Sean and I am a software engineer with experience in machine learning, data science, and web development.\n\n## Background\n\nA bit of background about myself. I graduated from university at the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020. My first job as a graduate was at Hummingbird Drones in 2021 where I worked on the Hummingbird Network project before switching to the Fire AI project. It wasn't until 2022 that we hired another developer. Until this point, I implemented and deployed the web app, cloud infrastructure, machine learning components, and GIS components.\n\n## Skills\n\nIn terms of web development, I am proficient in the use of Reactjs\n& NextJS, TailwindCSS, Docker, Terraform, and AWS. In the realm of\ndata science, I have some experience in customer segmentation, customer\nlifetime value prediction, and churn prediction. My knowledge of\nmachine learning focuses on computer vision and NLP, and I have\nexperience working with RCNN models and detection tasks.\n\n## Thanks\n\nThanks again for visiting my site. While you are here, enjoy an image of my partner's family dog, Timmy. This image was generated using a dreambooth model fine-tuned on 20+ images.\n\n![Timmy](/static/images/first-post-introduction/timmy-stable-diffusion.jpg)\n",
